# Feed Reader testning

This is my fifth project in the Front End Web Development nanodegree at Udacity.

I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) already included. My task has been to complete the test suite and given TODO's in the `feedreader.js` file.


### How to run the application
You can rund the application in your browser by either clicking this [link] () or downloading the repository and opening `index.html`in your browser.
